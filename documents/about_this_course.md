What I want you to learn:
Overall, you should gain skill and confidence in your programming.  There are a few specific things that I really want you to be comfortable will because they will help open up more advanced computing science to you:
- simple data structures
- scope
- recursion
- complexity
- algorithms (via searching and sorting)
- error checking and exceptions
- using other people's code
- data structures with associated functions

I will try to design the lectures, labs, and assessments around these ideas.

I also want you to be excited about computing science, and have a chance to hear about some of the computing research things going on.  I will try to have guest speakers every so often at live online sessions to talk to us about their computing research - if there's a field you'd like to hear from you are welcome to let me know and I'll try to find someone.  

How it will work:

Lectures/Recordings:
I will use Jupyter notebooks for most of the teaching so that I can interleave text and code.  Where applicable, I will provide *two* copies of the notebooks:
1. One missing code that I write during the recorded lecture, and with any blanks that I want you to work through
2. One with the code I talk through in the recordings but that may still have blanks for some bits I want you to try

End-of-course Exam


Tools we will use:

I am planning to use a number of tools throughout this semester, including:
- Jupyter notebooks: (I run these via Anaconda, but you are welcome to use any method you like.  I will link a guide to using these in the first week.  I will also usually try to include Binder links for the notebooks so you can run them online if you like.)
- Recorded videos: these will mostly be me going through the notebooks I prepare
- slido: this will let you anonymously ask questions or make requests
- Moodle: all course information will be available on the Moodle page, some is also available on GitHub
- GitHub: I'll be maintaining a repo with notebooks and other materials for the course, but use this only if it is convenient for you.  Moodle will be the authoritative source.
- more may be added as we go 

For your labs and learning you are welcome to use any way that you like to run Python code. This might be Jupyter notebooks, an IDE, or for little bits of code an online service like repl.it
